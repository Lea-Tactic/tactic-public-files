reStructuredText is a file format and markup language that software developers and technical writers use to produce technical documentation for Python-based software programs. When processed using the Python Docutils tool or another documentation-processing program, the markup symbols that reStructuredText (RST) files contain are transformed into text formatting.
For example, to add a bulleted list to an RST file, an author would write the following:
- Bulleted list item
- Bulleted list item
- Bulleted list item
When processed by a documentation-processing program, the above text would be shown as:
    • Bulleted list item
    • Bulleted list item
    • Bulleted list item
RST files can also contain symbols used to indicate that text should be bolded (** **), italicized (* *), or transformed into a section header (=====) or sub-header (-----). They may also include links to images and URLs.
